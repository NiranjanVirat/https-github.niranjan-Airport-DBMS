### Extended Entity Relationship (EER) Diagram

-   An EER Diagram would consist properties like Specialisation & Generalisation.
    -   Suppose, an employee in this system can be **_specialised_** into entities like:
        -   Administration
        -   Security
        -   Engineers
        -   Traffic Monitor
    -   And, different types of flights, like Airbus, Boeing can be **_generalised_** into one single entity _Flight_.
